\noindent \textbf{Exercise Number: 3.6.6}  %% FILL THIS IN

\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Proposition.} Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be three independent random variables, and set $W = X + Y$. Let \[B_{k,n} = \{(n-1) 2^{-k} \leq X < n 2^{-k}\}\] \[C_{k,m} = \{(m-1) 2^{-k} \leq Y < m 2^{-k}\}\] and let \[A_k = \bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} (B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}).\] Finally, let $A = \{X + Y < x\}$ and $D = \{Z < z\}$. Then the following hold:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item $\{A_k\} \nearrow A$

\item $A_k$ and $D$ are independent 

\item $A$ and $D$ are independent 

\item $W$ and $Z$ are independent.

\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\noindent \textbf{Proof.} 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item First we demonstrate that $A_k$ is increasing. Take any arbitrary $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then we must show $A_k \subseteq A_{k + 1}$. Consider any $\omega \in A_k$. Then for some $n,m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\omega \in B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}$, where $(n + m)2^{-k} < x$., and so \[\{(n-1) 2^{-k} \leq X(\omega) < n 2^{-k}\} \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \{(m-1) 2^{-k} \leq Y(\omega) < m 2^{-k}\}.\] Writing these in terms of $2^{-(k + 1)}$ yields \[\{2(n-1) 2^{-k-1} \leq X(\omega) < (2n) 2^{-k-1}\} \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \{2(m-1) 2^{-k-1} \leq Y(\omega) < (2m) 2^{-k-1}\}\] which immediately implies $\omega$ lies in some intersection of $B_{k+1,2n-1}$ or $B_{k+1,2n}$, and then $C_{k+1,2m-1}$ or $C_{k+1,2m}$ (choosing one of the $B$'s and one of the $C$'s). We need only demonstrate now that $(2n + 2m) 2^{-k - 1} < x$ (the worst case scenario), which follows immediately since $(n + m) 2^{-k}$ is true by assumption. 

Secondly we demonstrate that $\cup A_k = A$. The fact that $\cup A_k \subseteq A$ follows immediately, so we focus on the reverse. Consider any $\gamma \in \{\omega \mid (X+Y)(\omega) < x\}$. Let $a = X(\gamma)$ and $b = Y(\gamma)$ and  $a + b = c < x$. Since $2^{-k} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, there must exist a $p$ such that $2^{-p} < x - c$, which implies there exists a $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $c < z 2^{-p} < x$. Thus \[A_z = \bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-z} < x}} (B_{z,n} \cap C_{z,m})\] and, since the $B_{z,n}$ and $C_{z,m}$ each separately partition the set $[0, 2^{z})$, there is some $n$ and $m$ satisfying these conditions such that $(n-1)2^{-z} \leq a < n 2^{-z}$ and $(m-1)2^{-z} \leq b < m 2^{-z}$, and so we finally have $\gamma \in A_z$. 


\item Consider $\mathbb{P}(A_k \cap D)$. By definition this equals  \[\mathbb{P}\Bigg[ D \cap \Big( \bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} (B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}) \Big) \Bigg].\] By DeMorgan's Laws and/or basic set theory, we may rewrite as \[\mathbb{P}\Bigg[ \bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} (D \cap B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}) \Bigg].\] Now note that each of the $(D \cap B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m})$ are disjoint from another, because they each are subsets of respective partitions of $\Omega$ (the partitions being the $B$'s and the $C$'s, partitioned by how $X$ and $Y$ respectively map to the reals) and so we may apply countable subadditivity of your measure to yield  \[\mathbb{P}\Bigg[ \bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} (D \cap B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}) \Bigg] = \sum_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} \mathbb{P}(D \cap B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m})\] which, since $D$, $B_{k,n}$, $C_{k,m}$ are all Borel and therefore independent (by virtue of being defined by $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, respectively and exclusively), is equivalent to \[\sum_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} \mathbb{P}(D) \mathbb{P}(B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m}) = \mathbb{P}(D) \mathbb{P} \Big[\bigcup_{\substack{n,m \in \mathbb{Z} \\ (n+m)2^{-k} < x}} B_{k,n} \cap C_{k,m} \Big] = \mathbb{P}(D) \mathbb{P}(A_k).\]

\item By $(a)$, $(b)$, and continuity of probabilities (monotonically increasing/decreasing sequences of events), \[\mathbb{P}(A \cap D) = \mathbb{P}(\lim_{k \to \infty} A_k \cap D) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \mathbb{D} = \mathbb{P}(A) \mathbb{P}(D). \]

\item By definition, $W$ and $Z$ are independent if for all borel sets $S_1, S_2$, $W^{-1}(S_1)$ and $Z^{-1}(S_2)$ are independent events. By Chap 2 we know the sets $(-\infty, x]$ generate all Borel sets, so setting $A_x = \{X + Y < x\}$ and $D_z = \{Z < z\}$ and remembering that inverse images preserve all set operations under which $\sigma$-algebras are closed, there must exist countable collections of $A_x$ and $D_z$ generating $W^{-1}(S_1)$ and $Z^{-1}(S_2)$, respectively. By Lemma 3.5.2 these events are still independent since they are composed on independent events, completing the proof.
