\textbf{Exercise Number: 1.3.3}  %% FILL THIS IN

\medskip 

\noindent A probability measure is a function of subsets of the sample space $\Omega$. It stands to reason that the concept of finite addivity refers to the number of \emph{sets} input to the function as opposed to the number of elements in the sets itself. Thus, consider the sets $A_e$ of even numbers and $A_o$ of odd: disjoint, infinite sets. By the given information we have $P[A_e \cup A_o] = 1$ but $P[A_e] + P[A_o] = 2$ and so $P$ is not a valid measure here, as it is not finitely additive.
